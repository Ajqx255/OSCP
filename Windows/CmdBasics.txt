				Determine the default executable file extensions to search for and use, and in which order, left to right. The syntax is like the PATH variable - semicolon separators.
PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE 	 	AMD64/IA64/x86 This doesn't tell you the architecture of the processor but only of the current process, so it returns "x86" for a 32 bit WOW process running on 64 bit Windows. See detecting OS 32/64 bit
PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 	  	=%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% (but only available to 64 bit processes)
PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER 	 	Processor ID of the user's workstation.
PROCESSOR_LEVEL 	 	Processor level of the user's workstation.

SYSTEMDRIVE 	  		C:
SYSTEMROOT 	  		By default, Windows is installed to C:\Windows but there's no guarantee of that, Windows can be installed to a different folder, or a different drive letter. systemroot is a read-only system variable that will resolve to the correct location. Defaults in early Windows versions are C:\WINNT, C:\WINNT35 and C:\WTSRV
TEMP and TMP 	User Variable 	C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Temp  Under XP this was \{username}\Local Settings\Temp

USERPROFILE 	  		%SystemDrive%\Users\{username}  This is equivalent to the $HOME environment variable in Unix/Linux
WINDIR 	  			%windir% is a regular User variable and can be changed, which makes it less robust than %SystemRoot%
