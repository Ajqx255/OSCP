# Why use Chromium for Web Application Testing:
===============================================
# The primary reason I use Chromium is for DOM based XSS testing which as far as I know cannot be disabled in Firefox. 
# If you have never heard of Chromium it’s the opensource version of Google Chrome and doesn’t have flash player built in 
# and various other codecs such as: AAC, H.264, and MP3 Support.
# It’s possible to disable all security features in Chromium or Chrome using the switch --disable-web-security, 
# this will disable all security options and allow you to test for DOM based XSS.

# Kali Install Chromium Browser:
================================
# Chromium exists within the Kali repositories and can be installed using:

apt-get install chromium

# Chromium Won’t Launch on Kali
# By default chromium won’t launch on Kali Linux, this is due to chromium running as the root user. 
# You can fix this by opening /etc/chromium.d/default-flags in vim and adding the following lines:

# Run as root Kali
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --password-store=detect --no-sandbox --user-data-dir"
# This disables the user-data-dir and sandboxing, disabling sandboxing will have some obvious security issues but this browser is for web application penetration testing only.

#Chromium Setup for Web Application Testing
# In order to use chromium for Web Application Penetration Testing you need to disable all the security features, 
# allowing for DOM based XSS testing in chromium.

# Disable Chromium security features for web app testing
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --disable-web-security"

# Complete Chromium Config
# What my entire Chromium config looks like:
# A set of command line flags that we want to set by default.

# Do not hide any extensions in the about:extensions dialog
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --show-component-extension-options"

# Don't use the GPU blacklist (bug #802933)
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --ignore-gpu-blacklist"

# Run as root Kali
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --password-store=detect --no-sandbox --user-data-dir"

# Disable Chromium security features for web app testing
export CHROMIUM_FLAGS="$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --disable-web-security"

# Kali Chromium Error: You Are using an Unsupported Command line flag –disable-web-security. Security and Stability will suffer
# Ignore the following error, Chromium still process DOM based XSS. The same error occurs in Google Chrome.
